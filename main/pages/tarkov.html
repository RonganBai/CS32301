                        <p>Escape From Tarkov is an extraction-based first person shooter game with an emphasis on realism
                             and has PvP as well as PvE. Tarkov was created by Battlestate Games with development starting 
                             in 2012 and a beta version was released in 2017.</p>

                            other first person shooter games. There are hundreds of weapon attachments including optics, barrel 
                            attachments, foregrips and more to customize your gun with. There's also a variety of ammo types of

                            Tarkov's gameplay is centered around the idea of extraction. In a raid, you loot items and complete 
                            quests around the map and then survive by leaving at an extraction point. If another player or NPC 
                            kills you during a raid, you lose all your gear and items you had on you, which makes the gameplay 
                            punishing and intense. These gameplay features have been key to Tarkov's success and has lead other 
                            game studios to incorporate them in their own games.

                            Battlestate Games pioneered the extraction shooter genre with their game Escape From Tarkov. Some 
                            predict that this genre of first person shooter games will be the next big thing similar to how 
                            battle royale games became insanely popular a few years ago. Some companies have released extraction 
                            shooters with varying success:

                                    but is being shut down this year.
