            <h1>Halo and Competitive Multiplayer</h1>



                <h2> Halo CE | 2001 </h2>

                <p> The Halo franchise was originally developed by Bungie and released on the original Xbox. This franchise started with the release of
                    Halo Combat Evolved (CE) in 2001. Halo is a first person, arena shooter style game. Halo CE's release date was
                    before the release date of Xbox LIVE. This meant that in order to player multiplayer, player's either needed to use the split-screen
                    function or use a Local Area Connectio (LAN). Halo CE became extremely popular for LAN parties as it was very innovative for the time.

                <h2> Halo 2 | 2004 </h2>
                <p> Halo 2 was the second game released in the Halo franchise, game was also released on the original Xbox. The story mode of this game was a direct sequel to the events in Halo CE. This game
                    was released after Xbox LIVE (2002). Xbox LIVE allowed players all across the world to play with another over the internet. This eliminated the needed
                    for LAN connections. This was a huge step forward in online competitive gaming. Along with being built for Xbox LIVE, Halo 2 also introduced a "True Skill"
                    ranking system. This made it so players with similar skill ratings played against one another. A player's skill rating would increase with wins and decrease
                    with losses.

                    </div>
                    
                    <h5> Halo 2 Pregame Lobby </h5>
                    <br></br>

                </p>
                <h2> Halo 3 | 2007 </h2>
                <p> Halo 3 was the third game and also a sequel to the events of Halo 2. Halo 3 released in a time where Xbox LIVE and online gaming in general was becoming extremely
                    popular. This game released on the Xbox 360, which was more powerful than the original Xbox. This allowed for Halo 3 to have much better graphics and performance.
                    Halo 3 improved upon the ranking system introduced in Halo 2. Halo 3 had an experienced based ranking system and a "True Skill" ranking system. 
                    <br></br>
                    Halo 3 separated these functions with two separate playlists, ranked and social. In the ranked playlist, players were restricted to only playing against those with a similar skill rating, 
                    plus or minus 10 skill levels. The social playlist did not have such limitation, but there was no penalty for losing the game in social. A player needed a combination of
                    rank and experience to obtain the highest levels. The top rank was called 5-Star General and required five-thousand experience points and a skill rating of 50 in any ranked
                    playlist.
                    <br></br>
                    This is similar to the ranking system seen in games today. Typically, a game that was developed with the intention of being competitive will have some sort of "True Skill"
                    rating. It is popular in today's games to have a seasonal rank. This rank is typically reset at the start of a new season. This has its pros and cons but the primary idea
                    is the same as seen in Halo 2 and Halo 3.
                    <br></br>  
                    The image below shows all of the Halo 3 ranks. Starting at the left there is a rank of "Recruit" and at the bottom right there is a rank of "5-Star General."
                    If a player achieved the gold bars beneath their rank, the only way to achieve a level beyond that was to increase their "True Skill" rating.
