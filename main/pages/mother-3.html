                        <h2>GBA | 2006</h2>
                        <p>MOTHER 3 focuses on exploring the game world from a top-down perspective and engaging in turn-based combat with enemies.</p>
                            <p>Despite never being released outside of Japan, it was a critical and commercial success, and has generated a cult following. </p>

                <div style="padding: 0 60px;">
                <p>What was once an obscure part of Nintendo history has become one of the most enduring legacies the company has ever produced in video game history.</p> <br />
                    <p>It received praise for its character development, stylized graphics, music, and story. These passionate fans soon began making their own MOTHER-inspired games.</p>

                    <div class="right">
                        <p>The biggest of these indie RPGs is definitely UNDERTALE and to a certain extent its spiritual successor DELTARUNE.</p><p>&nbsp</p>
                           <p>UNDERTALE creator Toby Fox created a number of his own MOTHER ROM hacks before deciding to make UNDERTALE.</p>

                    <div class="mod-descript left">
                        <p>Another major indie game that took inspiration from MOTHER 3 is OMORI, which shares MOTHER 3's suburban adventure with an underlying tone of despair.</p>
                           <p>OMORI creator OMOCAT credits MOTHER 3 as inspiration for the zany atmosphere, stylization, and subsersive turn-based combat both games share.</p>

                    <div class="right">
                        <p>Lastly, MOTHER 3 is well known for subverting the typical RPG game formula by using similar elements to curate wholesome, introspective, and non-combative gaming experiences. </p><p>&nbsp</p>
                           <p>These traits are best exemplified in games such as CELESTE and Night in the Woods.</p>
