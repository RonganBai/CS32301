                            <p> Fortnite is a 100 player Battle Royale free for all where the last player or team standing wins. 
                                Fortnite began development as a PVE looter shooter game in 2011, and properly released in 2017. 
                                A few months after release, the popular Battle Royale gamemode was released, taking the world by storm. 
                                To this day Fortnite remains one of the most popular Battle Royale games on the market.

                            <p>Priced at a relatively low 10 dollars, the battle pass provides 100s of limited time cosmetics. 
                                Completing the entire pass earns enough premium currency to allow the user to purchase the next pass. 
                                This is a relatively low earning system for Epic Games, however it puts the emphasis on playtime and
                                player retention instead. This lead Fortnite to keep players on their game instead of competitors as
                                players are eager to be the first to unlock a specific cosmetic at the start of a season, or played 
                                would be eager to play nonstop to finish the pass at the end of a season before the cosmetics are lost forever.

                                The second is the rotating item shop. Instead of players having to gamble for what they want through loot boxes,
                                players could find cosmetics not included in the battle pass directly purchasable. The catch is that only a few
                                will be available at a time. This incentivized players to load the game every day to see what was new, or to 
                                see if a cosmetic they've wanted is in the shop that day. The artificial scarcity also manipulates players into
                                making impulse purchases, as they do not want to miss out on something they find cool.

                        Fortnite managed to develop a system that catered towards player retention instead of gambling mechanics. This system
                        also respects the player more, as a player does not feel slighted due to being unlucky with loot boxes or just not
                        being able to purchase very many. Every player can get what they want, which captures the demographic that wont want 
                        to gamble. High spenders can collect tons of cosmetics, so they aren't left out of this monetization plan. And finally 
                        with the Battle Pass, players are incentivized to constantly play the game, and are rewarded with an unending stream 
                        of cosmetics as long as they finish each pass.

                                As time goes on, this model that was originally praised has been more unpopular because of the time investment 
                                every game now requires. Despite this, it is still extremely successful and is added to most online games in all
                                sorts of different genres even years after its implmentation in Fortnite. Here are some popular games that have used this model:
